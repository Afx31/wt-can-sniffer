# wt-can-sniffer

Just another CAN Sniffer which I'll build to cater my own needs.

Initially I'll do as a web view for ease of use across all OS's.

### Goals
- Ability to sniff any CAN network (`vcan0`, `can0`, etc)
- Live view of current CAN Bus stream
- Function to record the data via button click, save to local db and/or `.csv` for later viewing
- Allow the user to view the recorded data in a view, clicking through each received value for each CAN Frame
